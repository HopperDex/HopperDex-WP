## **Trading System Architecture**

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Trading System Architecture.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Hopper's trading system employs a breakthrough **hybrid architecture design** that innovatively combines **Automated Market Maker (AMM)** and **Centralized Limit Order Book (CLOB)** mechanisms. Through dynamically adjusted liquidity curves and multi-tiered liquidity pool design, the system can simultaneously meet the needs of transactions of different scales:

* **Small transactions** (<$10,000): Confirmation time **<2 seconds**
* **Large transactions** (>$1,000,000): Slippage controlled within **<0.5%**
* **Capital utilization**: **35%** improvement over traditional DEXs

At the order execution level, Hopper has developed an intelligent routing system that automatically analyzes and selects the optimal trading path. The system integrates an **8-layer deep price discovery mechanism** that calculates the depth and price of different liquidity pools in real-time, implementing multi-path split execution strategies that bring significant advantages to traders:

* **Large order transaction cost savings**: Up to **40%**
* **Smart splitting with minimal price impact**: Only **0.1%**
* **Path optimization calculation time**: <**10 milliseconds**

To ensure the security and stability of transactions, Hopper has built a comprehensive risk control system. The system monitors various anomalies in real-time, including price fluctuations, liquidity changes, and suspicious trading patterns. At the same time, **MPC (Multi-Party Computation)** and **smart contract audits** ensure the security of platform assets. In case of anomalies, the system can respond quickly and initiate corresponding protection mechanisms.

In terms of performance optimization, Hopper adopts a combination of on-chain and off-chain approaches:

* **On-chain optimization**: Through carefully designed smart contracts and transaction instructions, Gas costs are reduced by **30%** compared to traditional DEXs
* **Off-chain processing**: High-performance off-chain services handle order matching and market data, ensuring millisecond-level response
* **Hybrid architecture**: Combining on-chain security with off-chain efficiency to provide users with the best trading experience

This innovative architectural design not only guarantees the high performance and reliability of the system but also leaves ample room for future expansion, supporting the ability to process **10,000+** transaction requests per second.

## **Multi-Chain Support**

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Multi Chain Support.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Hopper's multi-chain support strategy is founded on two high-performance public chains, **BNB Chain** and **Solana**, and extends to other mainstream blockchain networks through innovative cross-chain infrastructure. Our cross-chain architecture adopts an advanced **two-layer design**:

* **Bottom layer**: A secure and reliable cross-chain message transmission network ensuring information integrity and transmission security
* **Upper layer**: Highly optimized asset bridging and trading routing system, achieving seamless user experience

**Core Performance Indicators**:

* On-chain transaction confirmation: **<1 second**
* Cross-chain transfer success rate: **99.99%**
* Daily cross-chain transaction volume cap: **$50,000,000**

Among the public chains supported in the initial phase, besides Solana, we have prioritized integration with **Ethereum**, **BNB Chain**, and **Base**, which carry the most active DeFi ecosystems and user communities. Through deep strategic partnerships with top cross-chain infrastructure providers such as **Wormhole**, **LayerZero**, and **Axelar**, Hopper ensures the security and efficiency of cross-chain asset transfers. Especially in the Solana ecosystem, our intelligent cross-chain solution achieves:

* **Millisecond-level confirmation speed**: User experience close to centralized exchanges
* **Extremely low transfer costs**: Over 75% reduction in fees compared to traditional cross-chain bridges
* **Smart routing guarantee**: Automatically selects the optimal path, avoiding congested nodes

To optimize user experience, we have developed a breakthrough **cross-chain liquidity aggregation solution**. Users no longer need to manually transfer assets between different chains but can complete one-stop cross-chain transactions directly on Hopper. For example, users can directly purchase tokens on **Solana** using USDT on **Ethereum**, and the system will automatically complete the cross-chain transfer and token exchange process in the background. This innovative experience brings significant advantages:

* Support for seamless cross-chain exchange of **15+** mainstream tokens
* **40%** savings on cross-chain transaction fees
* One-stop cross-chain transaction completion time **<15 seconds**
* User operation steps reduced by **over 60%**

In terms of security, Hopper implements industry-leading security assurance mechanisms:

1. **Multi-Party Computation (MPC) Technology**: Distributed key management eliminates the risk of single-point failure
2. **Real-time Multi-layer Monitoring System**: Every cross-chain transaction undergoes strict security checks
   * Amount limits and threshold controls
   * Address verification and whitelist mechanisms
   * Behavioral pattern anomaly detection
3. **Cross-chain Asset Reserve Pool**: Ensures users can quickly withdraw assets at any time without waiting for cross-chain confirmation
4. **Intelligent Anti-attack System**: Automatically identifies and blocks malicious attack behaviors

In the future, as the blockchain ecosystem expands, Hopper will gradually extend support to **Layer 2** solutions and emerging high-performance public chains based on market demands and user feedback, ultimately realizing a truly seamless interconnected multi-chain DeFi ecosystem, providing users with borderless, low-friction global asset liquidity.

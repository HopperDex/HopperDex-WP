# Marketing Strategy

## **Brand Positioning**

Hopper positions itself as a next-generation multi-chain trading infrastructure with "all-in-one, ultra-fast, secure" as its core value proposition. Through innovative hybrid trading mechanisms and cutting-edge MPC wallet technology, we provide users with the ultimate solution for cross-chain asset management. We focus on building a professional and modern brand image, emphasizing breakthrough innovations in trading speed, security, and user experience. Hopper is not just a trading platform but a bridge connecting multi-chain ecosystems, allowing users to easily manage assets across all chains within a single interface, experience millisecond-level trading speeds, while enjoying institutional-grade security protection.

## **User Acquisition Strategy**

For user acquisition, we employ an innovative "multi-chain coverage + incentive mechanisms" model. The platform launches a comprehensive referral program where referrers receive 20% of the referred users' trading fees as permanent rebates, while referred users enjoy a 15% discount on trading fees. For different blockchain user communities, we will organize targeted trading competitions with million-dollar prize pools, offering rewards based on multi-dimensional metrics such as trading volume and cross-chain transaction frequency. By collaborating with leading projects across major blockchains, we can precisely reach our target user groups. We project that the cost of acquiring a single active user will decrease from $15-20 in the early stages to $8-10 as our platform matures.

## **Community Building Plan**

Our community building adopts a "multi-chain governance" model, establishing a cross-chain community alliance. We will create dedicated communities for each mainstream blockchain while promoting interactions between cross-chain communities through a unified governance framework. Through the establishment of a professional content creator program, we encourage community members to share cross-chain trading strategies and experiences. We will set up a cross-chain innovation fund to support innovative projects that enhance multi-chain interoperability. Simultaneously, we will organize global cross-chain hackathons and developer conferences to promote integration and innovation across multiple blockchain ecosystems.

## **Partnership Strategy**

Hopper's partnership strategy revolves around the concept of a "multi-chain ecosystem," focusing on developing three types of partnerships: global top market makers, cross-chain infrastructure providers, and innovative project teams. Collaborations with professional market makers ensure sufficient liquidity across all chains, while deep partnerships with cross-chain infrastructure projects enhance cross-chain transaction efficiency. We actively engage with quality projects on various blockchains to bring diverse project sources to our Launchpad. Special emphasis is placed on partnerships with wallet service providers, empowering them with our MPC technology to jointly enhance user asset security.

## **Market Education Plan**

To help users better understand and participate in cross-chain DeFi, we are launching a systematic market education program. We will establish Hopper Academy, offering professional courses on multi-chain trading strategies, cross-chain arbitrage techniques, and MPC wallet security. Through collaborations with industry experts, we will regularly host cross-chain trading seminars and security workshops to help users master cross-chain asset management skills. Simultaneously, we will build a professional research team to continuously produce high-quality market analysis and educational content covering developments and investment opportunities across major blockchains, helping users make informed decisions in the complex cross-chain environment.

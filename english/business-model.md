# Business Model

## **Revenue Streams**

Hopper platform's revenue structure consists of four major components, with trading fees accounting for 50% of total revenue as the platform's primary income source. The platform implements a highly competitive 0.2% base trading fee, with a differentiated fee structure serving different user segments. For large-volume traders and market makers, rates can be as low as 0.02%; VIP users enjoy tiered fee discounts with rates as low as 0.05%. The platform has launched comprehensive trading incentive programs, including volume-based rebates, market maker incentives, and referral profit sharing, creating a multi-layered incentive system to promote trading activity.

Launchpad services contribute 25% of platform revenue, employing a "basic services + value-added services" dual-track fee model. Basic services include standard project launch fees charged at 2% of project valuation; value-added services include marketing promotion, technical support, and security audits, with customized service packages ranging from $50,000 to $300,000 depending on project requirements. After project launch, the platform continuously receives 0.1% of the project's trading volume, with an additional 0.2% share during the first month. For exceptional projects, the platform provides comprehensive incubation services, including technical architecture optimization, marketing strategy planning, and liquidity management.

Cross-chain business, as an innovative revenue stream, represents 15% of total revenue. The platform has established a comprehensive cross-chain fee structure with tiered rates based on transfer amounts, ranging from 0.3% for small transfers to 0.1% for large transfers. Institutional users can enjoy customized preferential rates as low as 0.05%. Through innovative liquidity aggregation technology, the platform provides users with optimal cross-chain transaction paths, earning 0.1%-0.3% service fees while reducing user costs. Additionally, the platform has developed value-added services such as cross-chain data services, API interfaces, and customized solutions, offering institutional users comprehensive cross-chain infrastructure support.

## **Pricing Strategy**

Hopper employs a dynamic pricing mechanism, adjusting rates based on market conditions and user levels. VIP users can enjoy trading fees as low as 0.1%, while standard users pay 0.2%. For Launchpad business, a tiered pricing model is implemented where larger projects receive more favorable rates. Cross-chain business fees are dynamically adjusted based on the congestion of target networks, ensuring the platform always maintains market competitiveness. Additionally, we offer customized fee structures for strategic ecosystem partners.

## **User Acquisition Cost**

Through an innovative "community-driven + incentive mechanism" model, Hopper's user acquisition costs are significantly lower than industry averages. In the early stage, Hopper plans to invest $5 million in user incentives, with an estimated acquisition cost of $15-20 per active user. The platform has launched a comprehensive Referral Program where referrers receive 20% of the referred users' trading fees as permanent rebates, while referred users enjoy a 15% trading fee discount, creating a sustainable user growth flywheel.

The platform will regularly host large-scale Trading Contests with million-dollar prize pools, with rewards based on multi-dimensional metrics such as trading volume and position size, encouraging continued user activity. As brand awareness increases and community self-propagation effects strengthen, acquisition costs are expected to decrease to $8-10 within 12 months. Key focus will be on expanding the user base through social media marketing, KOL partnerships, and community building, while using data analytics to precisely target high-value user segments and improve marketing efficiency.

## **Revenue Projections**

Based on GMGN's actual revenue data (annualized revenue of $145 million) as a market benchmark [\[4\]](https://defillama.com/protocol/gmgn?groupBy=monthly), combined with our revenue structure and pricing strategy, we've developed the following phased revenue projections:

### **Launch Phase (1-3 months):**

* Daily average trading volume: $30 million
* Monthly total trading volume: $900 million
* Monthly revenue composition:
  * Trading fees (50%): $900M × 0.2% × 30% platform share = $540,000
  * Launchpad revenue (25%):
    * Initial fees: 5 projects × $500,000 average valuation × 2% = $50,000
    * Trading share: $900M × 0.1% = $900,000 × 30% platform share = $270,000
  * Cross-chain business (15%): $100M cross-chain volume × 0.1% fee = $100,000
  * Other services (10%): API services, staking yields, etc. = $80,000
* Total monthly revenue: Approximately $1 million

### **Stabilization Phase (4-8 months):**

* Daily average trading volume: $100 million
* Monthly total trading volume: $3 billion
* Monthly revenue composition:
  * Trading fees: $3B × 0.2% × 30% = $1.8 million
  * Launchpad revenue:
    * Initial fees: 8 projects × $1M average valuation × 2% = $160,000
    * Trading share: $3B × 0.1% × 30% = $900,000
  * Cross-chain business: $500M cross-chain volume × 0.1% = $500,000
  * Other services: $250,000
* Total monthly revenue: Approximately $3.6 million

### **Growth Phase (9-12 months):**

* Daily average trading volume: $200 million

  * Trading fees: $6B × 0.2% × 30% = $3.6 million
  * Launchpad revenue:
    * Initial fees: 12 projects × $1.5M average valuation × 2% = $360,000
    * Trading share: $6B × 0.1% × 30% = $1.8 million
  * Cross-chain business: $1B cross-chain volume × 0.1% = $1 million
  * Other services: $500,000
* Total monthly revenue: Approximately $7.2 million

### **Market Cycle Scenario Analysis:**

**Conservative Scenario (Bear Market):**

* Daily average trading volume reduced to $50 million

We project reaching approximately 50% of GMGN's current scale within 18 months under a neutral scenario, ensuring sustainable business growth.

## **Profit Model**

Hopper adopts a "light-asset operation + diversified revenue" profit model, achieving high-margin operations through technological innovation and efficiency optimization. The platform generates revenue through four main channels: trading fees, Launchpad services, cross-chain business, and other value-added services.

Trading business contributes 50% of revenue, employing a tiered fee structure that balances user needs with platform profitability through VIP user programs and market maker rebates. Standard rate: 0.2% per transaction, VIP user rates: 0.1%-0.15%, market maker rebates: up to 70%.

Launchpad business accounts for 25% of revenue, charging an initial launch fee of 2% of project valuation while also earning 0.1% continuous income from subsequent trading, with marketing service fees ranging from $50,000 to $100,000 per project.

Cross-chain business contributes 15% of revenue with a base rate of 0.2%, large-volume discounts of 0.1%, and customized institutional rates, providing the platform with stable cash flow.

Other value-added services include API services, data analytics, and institutional customized services. API services are initially priced from $2,000 per month, while data analytics services start from $1,000 per month.

In terms of cost control, the platform allocates 40% of expenditure to technological R\&D to ensure product competitiveness and security; 30% to marketing, including user incentives and brand building; 20% to daily operations, including customer service and legal compliance; and the remaining 10% as risk reserves and ecosystem development funds.

Through meticulous cost management and automated operations, we project a first-year gross margin of 40%, achieving break-even by the eighth month of operation. By the second year, as the user base expands and operational efficiency improves, we expect the gross margin to increase to 60% with a net profit margin of 35%.

To ensure sustainable development, the platform will continuously optimize operational efficiency, reducing operational costs through automation tools and intelligent risk control systems. Simultaneously, we will actively develop new business lines to expand revenue sources. In cash flow management, the platform will maintain adequate reserves to ensure stable operations during market fluctuations. Through this lightweight yet efficient operational model, Hopper can provide stable financial support for the platform's long-term development while maintaining market competitiveness.

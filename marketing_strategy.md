## **IV. Marketing Strategy**

### **Brand Positioning**

Hopper positions itself as the next-generation cross-chain trading infrastructure with "all-in-one, ultra-fast, secure" as its core value proposition. Through innovative hybrid trading mechanisms and cutting-edge MPC wallet technology, it provides users with the ultimate solution for cross-chain asset management. We focus on building a professional and modern brand image, emphasizing the product's breakthrough innovations in trading speed, security, and user experience. Hopper is not just a trading platform, but a bridge connecting multi-chain ecosystems, allowing users to easily manage cross-chain assets within a single interface, experience millisecond-level transaction speeds, and enjoy institutional-grade security.

### **User Acquisition Strategy**

For user acquisition, we adopt an innovative "multi-chain coverage + incentive mechanism" model. The platform launches a comprehensive referral program where referrers receive 20% of the referred user's transaction fees as a permanent rebate, while referred users enjoy a 15% transaction fee reduction. For different blockchain user groups, we will host targeted trading competitions with million-dollar prize pools, ranking and rewarding based on multi-dimensional metrics such as trading volume and cross-chain transaction frequency. Through partnerships with leading projects across major blockchains, we precisely reach target user groups, with the cost of acquiring a single active user expected to decrease from $15-20 in the early stages to $8-10.

### **Community Building Plan**

Community building adopts a "multi-chain co-governance" model, establishing a cross-chain community alliance. We will create dedicated communities for each mainstream blockchain while promoting interactions between cross-chain communities through a unified governance framework. Through the establishment of a professional content creator program, we encourage community members to share cross-chain trading strategies and experiences. A cross-chain innovation fund will be set up to support innovative projects that promote multi-chain interoperability. We will also organize global cross-chain hackathons and developer conferences to foster integration and innovation across multi-chain ecosystems.

### **Partnership Strategy**

Hopper's partnership strategy revolves around the "full-chain ecosystem," focusing on developing three types of partners: global top market makers, cross-chain infrastructure providers, and innovative project teams. Collaborating with professional market makers ensures sufficient liquidity across all chains, while deep cooperation with cross-chain infrastructure projects enhances cross-chain transaction efficiency. At the same time, we actively connect with quality projects from various blockchains, bringing diversified project sources to our Launchpad. We particularly emphasize cooperation with wallet service providers, jointly improving user asset security through MPC technology.

### **Market Education Plan**

To help users better understand and participate in cross-chain DeFi, we launch a systematic market education plan. We establish Hopper Academy, offering professional courses on full-chain trading strategies, cross-chain arbitrage techniques, MPC wallet security, and more. Through collaboration with industry experts, we regularly hold cross-chain trading seminars and security workshops to help users master cross-chain asset management skills. We also build a professional research team that continuously produces high-quality market analyses and educational content, covering development trends and investment opportunities across major blockchains, helping users make informed decisions in the complex cross-chain environment.

## **III. Business Model**

### **Revenue Sources**

Hopper platform's revenue structure consists of four main components, with transaction fees accounting for 50% of total revenue, making it the platform's primary income source. The platform adopts a highly competitive 0.2% base transaction fee in the industry, serving different user groups through a differentiated fee system. For large traders and market makers, the rate can be as low as 0.02%; VIP users enjoy tiered fee discounts, down to a minimum of 0.05%. The platform has launched various trading incentive programs, including large transaction rebates, market maker incentives, and referral commissions, promoting trading activity through a multi-level incentive system.

Launchpad services contribute 25% of the platform's revenue, employing a dual-track "basic service + value-added service" fee model. Basic services include standard fees for project launches, charging 2% of the project valuation; value-added services include marketing promotion, technical support, and security audits, providing customized service packages ranging from $50,000 to $300,000 based on project requirements. After project launch, the platform will permanently collect 0.1% of the project's trading volume, with an additional 0.2% share in the first month. For outstanding projects, the platform also provides deep incubation services, including technical architecture optimization, marketing planning, and liquidity management for comprehensive support.

Cross-chain business, as an innovative business line, accounts for 15% of total revenue. The platform has established a comprehensive cross-chain fee system with tiered rates based on transfer amounts, ranging from 0.3% for small transfers to 0.1% for large transfers. Institutional users can enjoy more favorable customized rates, as low as 0.05%. Through innovative liquidity aggregation technology, the platform provides users with optimal cross-chain transaction paths, earning a 0.1%-0.3% service fee while reducing user costs. Additionally, the platform has developed value-added services such as cross-chain data services, API interfaces, and customized solutions, providing institutional users with comprehensive cross-chain infrastructure support.

### **Pricing Strategy**

Hopper employs a dynamic pricing mechanism, adjusting rates according to market conditions and user levels. VIP users can enjoy a minimum transaction fee rate of 0.1%, while regular users are charged 0.2%. For Launchpad business, a tiered pricing structure is adopted—the larger the project scale, the more favorable the rate. Cross-chain business fees are dynamically adjusted based on network congestion of the target chain, ensuring the platform always maintains market competitiveness. Additionally, we provide customized rate plans for strategic ecosystem partners.

### **User Acquisition Cost**

Through an innovative "community-driven + incentive mechanism" model, Hopper's user acquisition cost is significantly lower than the industry average. In the early stages, Hopper plans to invest $5 million in user incentives, with an estimated acquisition cost of $15-20 per active user. The platform has launched a comprehensive referral program where referrers receive 20% of the referred user's transaction fees as a permanent rebate, while referred users enjoy a 15% transaction fee reduction, building a sustainable user growth flywheel. We will also regularly host large-scale trading competitions with million-dollar prize pools, ranking and rewarding based on multi-dimensional metrics such as trading volume and holdings to encourage continued user activity. As brand awareness increases and community self-propagation effects strengthen, acquisition costs are expected to decrease to $8-10 within 12 months. The focus is on expanding the user base through social media marketing, KOL collaborations, and community building, while using data analysis to precisely target high-value user groups and improve marketing efficiency.

### **Revenue Forecast**

Based on GMGN's actual revenue data (annualized revenue of $145 million) as a market benchmark [[4]](https://defillama.com/protocol/gmgn?groupBy=monthly), combined with our revenue structure and pricing strategy, we have established the following phased revenue projections:

### **Profit Model**

Hopper adopts a "light-asset operation + diversified revenue" profit model, achieving high gross margin operations through technological innovation and efficiency optimization. In terms of revenue structure, the platform primarily generates income through four aspects: transaction fees, Launchpad services, cross-chain business, and other value-added services.

Transaction business contributes 50% of revenue, employing a tiered fee structure and balancing user needs with platform profits through VIP user programs and market maker rebates. Standard rate: 0.2% per transaction, VIP user rate: 0.1%-0.15%, market maker rebate: up to 70%.

Launchpad business accounts for 25%, collecting not only an initial launch fee of 2% of project valuation but also earning 0.1% continuous revenue from subsequent trading, with marketing service fees ranging from $50,000-$100,000 per project.

Cross-chain business contributes 15% of revenue, with a base rate of 0.2%, large amount discount of 0.1%, and institutional customized rates, providing stable cash flow for the platform.

Other value-added services include API services, data analysis, and institutional customized services. API services are initially priced from $2,000 per month, while data analysis starts from $1,000 per month.

In terms of cost control, the platform allocates 40% of expenses to technology research and development, ensuring product competitiveness and security; 30% to marketing, including user incentives and brand building; 20% to daily operations, including customer service and compliance legal affairs; and the remaining 10% as risk reserves and ecosystem development funds. Through precise cost management and automated operations, we expect a 40% gross margin in the first year, achieving break-even in the 8th month of operations. By the second year, as the user base expands and operational efficiency improves, the gross margin is expected to increase to 60%, with a net profit margin of 35%.

To ensure sustainable development, the platform will continuously optimize operational efficiency, reducing operational costs through automated tools and intelligent risk control systems. Meanwhile, we will actively develop new business lines to expand revenue sources. In cash flow management, the platform will maintain sufficient reserves to ensure stable operations during market fluctuations. Through this lightweight but efficient operational model, Hopper can provide stable financial support for the platform's long-term development while maintaining market competitiveness.

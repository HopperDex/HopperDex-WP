### **Trading System Architecture**

Hopper's trading system adopts an innovative hybrid architecture design, with the core being a perfect combination of Automated Market Maker (AMM) and Centralized Limit Order Book (CLOB) mechanisms. Through dynamically adjusted liquidity curves and multi-level liquidity pool designs, the system can simultaneously meet the immediacy requirements of small transactions and the low slippage requirements of large transactions. Small transactions (<$10,000) have confirmation times of <2 seconds, large transactions (>$1 million) have slippage of <0.5%, and capital utilization is increased by 35%.

At the order execution level, Hopper has developed a smart routing system that can automatically analyze and select the optimal trading path. With an 8-layer deep price discovery mechanism, large order trading costs are reduced by up to 40%, and smart splitting achieves a minimum price impact of 0.1%. The system calculates the depth and price of different liquidity pools in real-time, ensuring users get the most favorable execution price through multi-path split execution. Especially when handling large orders, smart routing can effectively reduce price impact, saving users significant trading costs.

To ensure transaction security and stability, Hopper has built a comprehensive risk control system. The system monitors various anomalies in real-time, including price fluctuations, liquidity changes, and suspicious trading patterns. At the same time, MPC (Multi-Party Computation) and smart contract audits ensure the security of platform assets. In the event of anomalies, the system can respond quickly and activate corresponding protection mechanisms.

In terms of performance optimization, Hopper employs a combination of on-chain and off-chain approaches. By optimizing smart contracts and trading instructions, on-chain operation costs are minimized. Gas costs are reduced by 30% compared to traditional DEXs. Meanwhile, high-performance off-chain services handle order matching and market data, ensuring users enjoy a smooth trading experience. This architectural design not only guarantees the system's high performance and reliability but also leaves ample room for future expansion.

### **Multi-Chain Support**

Hopper's multi-chain support strategy is based on BNB and Solana, expanding to other mainstream public chains through innovative cross-chain infrastructure. Our cross-chain architecture adopts a two-layer design: the bottom layer is a secure and reliable cross-chain message transmission network, and the upper layer is an optimized asset bridging and transaction routing system. On-chain transaction confirmation takes <1 second, cross-chain transfer success rate is 99.99%, and the daily cross-chain transaction limit is $50 million.

Among the first-phase supported public chains, besides Solana, we prioritized integration with Ethereum, BNB Chain, and Base, which carry the most active DeFi ecosystems. Through deep cooperation with top cross-chain infrastructure like Wormhole and LayerZero, Hopper ensures the security and efficiency of cross-chain asset transfers. Especially in the Solana ecosystem, smart cross-chain solutions can achieve millisecond-level confirmation speeds and extremely low transfer costs.

To optimize user experience, we have developed an innovative cross-chain liquidity aggregation solution. Users do not need to manually transfer assets between different chains but can complete cross-chain transactions directly on Hopper. For example, users can directly purchase tokens on Solana using USDT on Ethereum, and the system will automatically complete the cross-chain transfer and token exchange. This one-stop cross-chain trading experience greatly reduces the operational complexity for users. It supports cross-chain swaps of 15+ mainstream tokens, saves 40% on cross-chain transaction fees, and completes one-stop cross-chain transactions in <15 seconds.

In terms of security, Hopper implements MPC (Multi-Party Computation) mechanisms and real-time monitoring systems. Each cross-chain transaction undergoes strict security checks, including amount limits, address verification, and anomaly detection. At the same time, Hopper has established cross-chain asset reserve pools to ensure users can quickly withdraw assets at any time without waiting for cross-chain confirmation.

In the future, Hopper will gradually expand to more public chains based on market demand and ecosystem development, ultimately achieving a truly seamless interconnected multi-chain DeFi ecosystem.

### **Launchpad Function Explanation**

Hopper Launchpad, as a next-generation token launch platform, pays special attention to project quality and user experience while maintaining efficiency and convenience. Hopper's launch mechanism optimizes the shortcomings of traditional IDO platforms, innovatively solving industry pain points such as bot participation and price volatility.

In terms of the launch process, we have adopted a "liquidity-first" strategy. Unlike the complicated listing requirements of traditional platforms, on Hopper, project teams only need to meet basic liquidity conditions to list for trading on Hopper DEX. Project launch time is reduced to 15 minutes, the minimum initial liquidity requirement is $100,000, and the first-day trading depth guarantee is $5 million. This mechanism both ensures adequate market liquidity and significantly shortens the time window from launch to trading. Especially for MEME token projects, this fast and efficient launch mechanism can better capture market momentum.

To protect user interests, Hopper has designed innovative anti-dumping and anti-bot systems. Through smart contract-level transaction restrictions and dynamic pricing mechanisms, it effectively prevents whale manipulation and bot participation. Bot identification accuracy is 99.9%, AI risk assessment response time is <100ms, and abnormal behavior warning accuracy is 95%. At the same time, our AI risk assessment system monitors project performance in real-time, alerts for abnormal behavior, and helps users make more informed investment decisions.

Project teams can customize launch parameters through an intuitive control panel, including initial liquidity, token allocation, unlocking mechanisms, etc. We also provide professional marketing support and technical consulting services to help quality projects gain more exposure and user attention. Through deep integration with Hopper DEX, projects can immediately gain sufficient trading depth and market activity upon launch.

### **Technical Innovation Points**

Hopper's technical innovation in the DeFi field is mainly reflected in three core aspects. First is the innovative hybrid market-making mechanism, where we perfectly combine the simplicity of traditional AMM with the capital efficiency of CLMM, developing a unique dynamic liquidity curve algorithm. Capital efficiency is improved by 35%, slippage loss is reduced by 50%, and price stability is enhanced by 40%. This allows liquidity providers to control their capital allocation more precisely while providing more favorable prices and lower slippage for traders.

Hopper's smart trading routing system analyzes the depth and price of multiple liquidity pools in real-time. The system can automatically split large orders and select the optimal execution path. Especially when handling cross-chain transactions, our routing algorithm comprehensively considers cross-chain fees, liquidity depth, and price impact to find the most cost-effective trading solution for users. The system integrates AI prediction models to identify potential arbitrage opportunities and risks in advance. Arbitrage space is compressed to within 0.1%, price prediction accuracy is 85%+, and optimal path calculation time is <10ms.

Additionally, regarding the token launch mechanism, Hopper has developed a unique "Liquidity Smart Lock" system that effectively prevents malicious dumping by project teams and whales through dynamic adjustment of lock periods and unlock curves. At the same time, Hopper's anti-bot system employs innovative behavior recognition algorithms that can distinguish and block bot transactions at the millisecond level, ensuring fair participation opportunities for ordinary users.

These technical innovations not only enhance the platform's performance and user experience but also provide new solutions for the development of the entire DeFi ecosystem. We will continue to invest in research and development, exploring more technological breakthroughs to drive the innovative development of decentralized finance.

### **Security Design**

Hopper considers security as the primary factor in platform design, adopting a multi-layered protection architecture to ensure the safety of user assets and transactions. At the smart contract level, we use formal verification methods for code auditing, and all core contracts undergo rigorous review by multiple top security companies. The core codebase is certified by 4 top audit institutions, with 100% code coverage. At the same time, Hopper implements tiered permission management and time-lock mechanisms to ensure the security of system parameter updates even in extreme situations.

In terms of asset custody, Hopper innovatively adopts MPC (Multi-Party Computation) technology, distributing private keys across multiple secure nodes. This distributed key management approach not only eliminates single point of failure risks but also provides a smooth user experience while maintaining high security. Especially when handling cross-chain assets, our security mechanisms can monitor abnormal transactions in real-time and ensure the security of asset transfers through multiple signatures.

The platform has also established a comprehensive risk control system, including real-time price monitoring, liquidity health detection, and trading pattern analysis. Hopper adheres to a strict 7/10 MPC signature mechanism, with abnormal transaction identification in <1 second. Our AI risk control engine can quickly identify potential attack behaviors, such as flash loan attacks, price manipulation, etc., and automatically trigger protection mechanisms. When anomalies are detected, the system immediately initiates emergency plans, including suspending related trading pairs, restricting large transfers, and other measures.

To further enhance security, we have established sufficient insurance funds and partnered with well-known insurance protocols to provide additional asset protection for users. At the same time, we maintain an active bug bounty program, encouraging white hat hackers to discover and report potential security vulnerabilities. Through these comprehensive security measures, Hopper is committed to creating a safe and reliable trading environment for users.
